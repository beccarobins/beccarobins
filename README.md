Hi there 👋, I'm Becca. I'm a Brooklyn-based Product Manager @ Microsoft. I help build data and reporting products that support Microsoft's end user and commercial content platforms. Previously, I worked at DataCamp, where I helped develop data science courses focused on Python, R, SQL, and Google Sheets.
